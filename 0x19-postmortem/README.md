## Root Cause and Resolution
- **Root Cause**: The primary cause was a misconfigured database index. A recent change in the database schema introduced a new index, which was not optimized for the high frequency of read and write operations occurring during peak traffic times. This misconfiguration led to significant delays in query processing, ultimately causing the application slowdown.
- **Resolution**: The resolution involved the database team identifying and optimizing the problematic index. Specifically, they:
  1. Analyzed the slow queries and identified the inefficient index.
  2. Dropped the misconfigured index.
  3. Created a new, optimized index tailored for the high-traffic query patterns.
  4. Tested the new index in a staging environment to ensure performance improvements.
  5. Deployed the changes to the production database, resulting in immediate performance gains.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

### Improvements/Fixes:
1. **Database Index Review**: Regularly review and optimize database indexes, especially after schema changes.
2. **Monitoring Enhancements**: Implement more granular monitoring for database query performance.
3. **Load Testing**: Conduct thorough load testing after any database schema changes to identify potential performance issues under high traffic conditions.
   
### Tasks:
- **Patch Nginx Server**: Ensure the latest patches are applied to web servers to handle traffic spikes more effectively.
- **Add Monitoring on Server Memory**: Implement detailed monitoring for server memory usage to quickly identify and respond to resource bottlenecks.
- **Automate Index Optimization**: Develop scripts to automate regular analysis and optimization of database indexes.
- **Review Incident Response Protocols**: Update and train staff on improved incident response procedures to ensure quicker identification of root causes in future outages.
- **Enhanced Logging**: Improve logging practices to capture more detailed information during high-traffic events for better diagnostics.
